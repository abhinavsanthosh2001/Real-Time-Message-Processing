# Real-Time-Message-Processing
# Overview
This project implements an asynchronous message processing system with partition logic and concurrency handling using [Java/Spring/other frameworks/tools] (depending on the technology stack). It focuses on efficiently processing messages, distributing them across partitions, and handling concurrent requests.

# Features
1. Asynchronous Message Processing
2. Partitioning Logic
3. Concurrency Management
1. Asynchronous Message Processing
The system processes messages asynchronously using [technology/framework]. This ensures non-blocking, efficient message handling. Hereâ€™s how the system works:

Queue/Topic: Messages are sent to a queue or topic (e.g., using RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc.).
Consumers: Consumers pick up these messages asynchronously without blocking the sender.
Processing: Once the message is picked, it is processed independently, leveraging async calls to improve throughput and reduce processing delays.

2. Partition Logic
Messages are distributed across multiple partitions based on the following logic:

Partition Key: Messages are assigned to partitions based on a key (e.g., user ID, region, or any other attribute).
Consistent Hashing: We use consistent hashing or round-robin distribution to ensure messages with the same key always go to the same partition. This helps in ensuring message order and load balancing across partitions.
The partitioning helps in:

Ensuring that related messages are processed together.
Reducing contention by distributing messages across multiple partitions.


3. Concurrency Handling
Concurrency is handled effectively to ensure no race conditions or data inconsistencies:

Thread Pools: The system uses thread pools to manage concurrency. By configuring thread pool sizes, the number of concurrent tasks can be controlled.
Locks: Critical sections of the code are synchronized using locks to prevent multiple threads from accessing shared resources simultaneously.
Optimistic/Pessimistic Locking: Depending on the use case, we may use optimistic or pessimistic locking mechanisms to handle concurrent updates on shared resources.
Deadlock Avoidance: The system implements strategies like lock ordering and timeouts to avoid potential deadlocks during concurrent execution.
